1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

getElementById("id") ==> Selects one element by id.

getElementsByClassName("class") ==> Selects multiple elements by the same className.

querySelector("selector") ==> Selects the first matching element by the tag, class or idName.

querySelectorAll("selector") ==> Selects all matching elements by tag, class or idName.





2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

Step-1 ==> Get the parent element

Step-2 ==> Create a child element

Step-3 ==> Add text or html into the child element (innerText/innerHTML)

Step-4 ==> Append the child element to the parent element





3. What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?

Event Bubbling means if I click or start an event it starts from the target element and then its parent and like this it moves to the body and html.





4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation means to add an event listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements. Thus, we can get multiple elements by using one event.
It uses event bubbling technique.

It is useful Because:

=> It reduces memory usage
=> Reduces memory leaks
=> Improves Performance
=> Makes the code cleaner and shorter





5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

preventDefault() ==> It stops the browser's default behavior for an event
Example: Form submit, Link open.

stopPropagation() ==> Stops target event from moving to parent. It is used to stop event bubbling.
